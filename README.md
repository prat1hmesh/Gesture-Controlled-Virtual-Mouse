# Gesture-Controlled-Virtual-Mouse
Gesture Controlled Virtual Mouse is a computer vision–based Python project that enables hands-free control of mouse movement and clicks using real-time hand gesture recognition through a webcam. Built using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI, the system tracks hand landmarks to perform cursor movement and click actions without any physical mouse.
